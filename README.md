# Team Generator

This was a group project I worked on with three other developers at Prime Digital Academy.
The purpose of this assignment was to create a random team generator that one of our instructors could use to assign students to teams based on the number of students on each team. This was our start to using AngularJS with a Node.js server and using a JSON file storing the information of the students.

## Instructions
Please feel free to fork this repository or download a copy of your own. In the command line of the root directory type in "npm start" to start the server and then type in "localhost:5000" to start the project. Select the number of teams you want and then press the refresh button.
